Exercise 9

Create a data model representing a Barn with Chickens 🐣
This model should provide answers to the following questions:
How many rooster, hen and chicks existed in the Barn on a specific date
How many chicks will come to age on a specific date


create table poultry (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    gender ENUM('male', 'female'),
    birthday DATETIME
);


show columns from poultry
    -> ;

let's make some data:

INSERT INTO poultry (birthday, gender) VALUES
    ("2016-07-18", "male"),
    ("2016-07-15", "female"),
    ("2016-07-04", "female"),
